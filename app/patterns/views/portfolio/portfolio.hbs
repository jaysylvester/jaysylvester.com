      <h1>A UX design manager's portfolio shouldn't be a bunch of pretty screens.</h1>
      <p>In fact, it may not have any finished screens at all. It could be made up entirely of process documentation, research data, ugly sketches, plain-looking wireframes, and half-baked prototypes that informed another designer's pretty screens.</p>
      <p>If you happen to be into the less-than-pretty side of UX—like me—here's a selection of documents from various projects:</p>
      <h2>Screens? I got screens.</h2>
      <p>Some of these are all me, some were started by me, some finished by me, and some are my teams' output. That's what it means to be a UX lead.</p>
      <p>For those of you who like to dig a little deeper, I have <a href="/case-studies">case studies</a> that delve into the story and process behind all those pretty screens:</p>
