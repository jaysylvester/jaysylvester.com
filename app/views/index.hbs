        Jay is one of the best managers I&apos;ve worked with in my career. Jay is an exceptional leader, inclusive and involved in the process, without micromanaging. He trusts in his team, and is receptive to feedback. Working on Jay&apos;s team, I felt energized with what we were creating, and that I was delivering my best.

        I've been working on the web for a long time, and to be able to work with someone that pushed me to learn more for all the right reasons was a breath of fresh air. Jay would be an asset to any frontend team and I can only hope our paths cross again.
