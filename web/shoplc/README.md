# Features

Some of the benefits demonstrated in this demo:

1. Simple, clean markup created from scratchâ€”no bloated frameworks.
2. Sass for CSS, which allows for nesting and other great features to simplify CSS and make it easier to read and navigate.
3. Concatenation and minification of CSS and JS files.
4. Lazy loading of images to prevent mobile devices from having to load large product images that the user might not even see.
